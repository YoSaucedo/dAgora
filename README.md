## Concepts
The structure of this contract and dApp relies upon a few concepts that deserve explanation:
* **Decentralized Product Hash (DPH)**: We've indexed the products in the productList using a SHA3 hash of the title, [GPC Segment](http://www.gs1.org/gpc), and creator's address. This is an early attempt at standardizing product ID's/Indexes for the purpose of making searchability and provable identity possible in the future. Suggestions for improving this standard are welcome.
* **Global Product Classification (GPC)**: For prodcut categorization we are relying on the [GS1 GPC standard](http://www.gs1.org/gpc) of catetegorization to make our marketplace compatible with existing standards.

## Current Limitations
* Single product purchases (no multi-product orders)
* All pricing is strictly in ETH
* Single merchant per contract
* No search
* No ability integrate delivery of physical items

## Unsolved Challenges
1. Dealing with indexes when products are removed.
  * In order to iterate over products, We've implemented a index to map a uint ID to a DPH. This will create issues when products are removed and the index is no longer sequential.
  * **Proposal 1**: Keep an seperate array of open productIndex's that can be used when new products are added. So instead of a new product creating a brand new index, it first checks to see whether there is an open slot available.
2. Providing searchability to products and orders.
  * We currently don't have an easy way for looking through the productList and attempting to match keywords to the fields in the Prodcut struct. Using the **DPH** allows for some primitive search, assuming the user knows the Title, Category, and Creator address.
  * The same is true for Orders
3. Maintaining privacy of orders so that only the order initiator and merchant can access order details.
  * As all order details exist on the public blockchain, it is feasible for anyone to find access to the order data of any user.
